The loop ASM example in the notes doesnt do what the HLL program does and the description says: take input, print back the original input, then input-1, etc. down to 1. Name it Loop.asm Submit as file attachment.

Also, write in ASM a program that will read input and print back 1 only if the input is between 5 and 10 inclusive. Name it If.asm and attach as 2nd file.
